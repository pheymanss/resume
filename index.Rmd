## Academic Experience

**Generalized Sentiment Scoring of Short Informal Text in Spanish**  
Natural Language Processing  
Developed in R, Aug 2016 - Jul 2017

- Fitting text sentiment scoring into a rigorous mathematical framework, we constructed a signed measure function and created a language-agnostic and category-agnostic text classification tool. 

**Flower Market Analysis Through Google Web Searches**  
Time Series Analysis  
Developed in R, Nov 2017 - Dec 2017

- Using basic time series analysis frameworks like ARIMA(p,q) models, we characterized the fluctuations and expected growth rate of the flower market based on time series analysis using web searches of the word "flowre".

**Betting Strategy Evaluation of Online MLB Matches**  
Backtesting  
Developed in VBA, Jun 2016 - Jul 2016

- We simulated the performance of several betting strategies for an individual with no prior sports knowledge, based solely on information that can be subtracted from online betting websites. We developed and tested a modified Martingale strategy which provided a high chance of profit in any subset of the time interval studied.
